# Topping Battle
Topping Battle is a two-player game where players choose their path on a grid and then start moving through the path. They can shoot at each other, and the game ends when one player shoots the other. If no player wins by the time the grid size shrinks to 6 by 6, the game is a tie.

# Installation
Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/ubongjc/pygame-battleship.git

# Usage
Choose between playing against another player or a computer player.
Select your path by clicking on the squares on the grid.
Once you and your opponent have selected your paths, click the play button to start moving through the path.
Use the arrow keys to shoot at your opponent.
If you hit your opponent, you win the game.
If the grid size shrinks to 6 by 6 and no one has won, the game is a tie.
